## tmp-image-gen
genereates images using textmeshpro tags in unity from .png files
(for this to work i save .png files through paint.net as 32bit png's)

i think this is bricked currently

### rewriting !!!
rewrite file is .cpp file

# next up:
1. add libpng
2. output file
3. fix alignment issue 
?. instead maybe have a mod in unity to insert it directly into tmp objects? pInvoke? rewrite c#?
