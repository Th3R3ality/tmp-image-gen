## tmp-image-gen
generates images using textmeshpro text in unity from .png files.
<p>creates a .txt file in the execution directory with the file name of the image used.</p>
<em><b>will overwrite any file with the same name and file extension without asking.</b></em>
<br></br>

### potential improvements
1. fix alignment issue 
2. instead maybe have a mod in unity to insert it directly into tmp objects? pInvoke? rewrite c#? idk someone else do that
